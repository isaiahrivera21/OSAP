Many ML researchers' process for building and deploying ML models is entirely manual, typically using scripting or notebooks. Especially for those with limited or no cloud or distributed systems experience. This project proposes a distributed, end-to-end service that simplifies MLOps and ETL (extract, transform, load) pipeline management for users with beginner-to-intermediate ML skills. The service will enable users to train, validate, deploy, and iteratively improve models via API-driven workflows, abstracting the complexities of cloud orchestration, scalability, and monitoring.
